I have successfully defended my PhD thesis on July 4th, 2024. It was an incredible journey, and I am grateful for the support and guidance from my advisors, committee members, and colleagues.

<!-- The committee highly complimented my presentation slides, which were meticulously crafted to convey the essence of my research effectively. -->
