Consequently, modeling realistic hand object interactions, including the subtle motion of individual fingers, is critical for applications in computer graphics, computer vision, and mixed reality. To address this challenge, we propose GRIP, a learning-based method that synthesizes the motion of both left and right hands before, during, and after interaction with objects. We leverage the dynamics between the body and the object to extract two types of novel temporal interaction cues. We then define a two-stage inference pipeline in which GRIP first outputs the consistent interaction motion by taking a new approach to modeling motion temporal consistency in the latent space. In the second stage, GRIP generates refined hand poses to avoid finger-to-object penetrations. Both quantitative experiments and perceptual studies demonstrate that GRIP outperforms existing methods and generalizes to unseen objects and motions. Furthermore, GRIP achieves real-time performance with 45 fps hand pose prediction. Our models and code will be available for research purposes.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"cc4b2fd6941d367fe8a5867780e085d7","permalink":"https://otaheri.github.io/publication/2023_grip/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_grip/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Hands are dexterous and highly versatile manipulators, that are central to how humans interact with objects and their environment.

Articulated objects are especially interesting since they often require the full dexterity of human hands to manipulate them. To understand, model, and synthesize such interactions, automatic and robust methods that reconstruct hands and articulated objects in 3D from a color image are needed. Existing methods for estimating 3D hand and object pose from images focus on rigid objects. In part, because such methods rely on training data and no dataset of articulated object manipulation exists. Consequently, we introduce ARCTIC – the first dataset of free-form interactions of hands and articulated objects. ARCTIC has 1.2M images paired with accurate 3D meshes for both hands and for objects that move and deform over time. The dataset also provides hand-object contact information. To show the value of our dataset, we perform two novel tasks on ARCTIC: (1) 3D reconstruction of two hands and an articulated object in interaction; (2) an estimation of dense hand-object relative distances, which we call interaction field estimation. For the first task, we present ArcticNet, a baseline method for the task of jointly reconstructing two hands and an articulated object from an RGB image. For interaction field estimation, we predict the relative distances from each hand vertex to the object surface, and vice versa. We introduce InterField, the first method that estimates such distances from a single RGB image. We provide qualitative and quantitative experiments for both tasks, and provide detailed analysis on the data.\nVideo ","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"3562e35d6d487017b16f8c99a4589e45","permalink":"https://otaheri.github.io/publication/2023_arctic/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_arctic/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract We use our hands to interact with and to manipulate objects.

To understand such interactions, computers need to reconstruct these from cameras observing whole-body interaction with scenes. This is challenging due to occlusion between the body and objects, motion blur, depth/scale ambiguities, and the low image resolution of hands and graspable object parts. To make the problem tractable, the community focuses either on interacting hands, ignoring the body, or on interacting bodies, ignoring hands. The GRAB dataset addresses dexterous whole-body interaction but uses marker-based MoCap and lacks images, while BEHAVE captures video of body object interaction but lacks hand detail. We address the limitations of prior work with InterCap, a novel method that reconstructs interacting whole-bodies and objects from multi-view RGB-D data, using the parametric whole-body model SMPL-X and known object meshes. To tackle the above challenges, InterCap uses two key observations: (i) Contact between the hand and object can be used to improve the pose estimation of both. (ii) Azure Kinect sensors allow us to set up a simple multi-view RGB-D capture system that minimizes the effect of occlusion while providing reasonable inter-camera synchronization. With this method we capture the InterCap dataset, which contains 10 subjects (5 males and 5 females) interacting with 10 objects of various sizes and affordances, including contact with the hands or feet. In total, InterCap has 223 RGB-D videos, resulting in 67,357 multi-view frames, each containing 6 RGB-D images. Our method provides pseudo ground-truth body meshes and objects for each video frame. Our InterCap method and dataset fill an important gap in the literature and support many research directions.

Hands have been separately studied but the focus has been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize virtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body motions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are challenging on their own and, together, the state-space of poses is significantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions differ, and the whole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints, and be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must look at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we address the problem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an unknown object. As input, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its position, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of whole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal whole-body grasp with a realistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as hand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion between the starting and goal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the object with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and grasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object contact. To achieve this the networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and 3D vertex offsets. We train and evaluate GOAL, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the GRAB dataset. Results show that GOAL generalizes well to unseen objects, outperforming baselines. A perceptual study shows that GOAL’s generated motions approach the realism of GRAB’s ground truth. GOAL takes a step towards synthesizing realistic full-body object grasping.

While “grasping” is commonly thought of as a single hand stably lifting an object, we capture the motion of the entire body and adopt the generalized notion of “whole-body grasps”. Thus, we collect a new dataset, called GRAB (GRasping Actions with Bodies), of whole-body grasps, containing full 3D shape and pose sequences of 10 subjects interacting with 51 everyday objects of varying shape and size. Given MoCap markers, we fit the full 3D body shape and pose, including the articulated face and hands, as well as the 3D object pose. This gives detailed 3D meshes over time, from which we compute contact between the body and object. This is a unique dataset, that goes well beyond existing ones for modeling and understanding how humans grasp and manipulate objects, how their full body is involved, and how interaction varies with the task. We illustrate the practical value of GRAB with an example application; we train GrabNet, a conditional generative network, to predict 3D hand grasps for unseen 3D object shapes.\nTL;DR We capture a very accurate dataset, named GRAB, of people interacting with 3D objects. We then use it to train a network, GrabNet, that generates hand grasp for novel objects.\nVideo Bloopers (Fun :D) Data and Code Please register and accept the License agreement on this website in order to get access to the GRAB dataset.
